    "Ans: the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is the way they measure the distance between data points.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Scale: Euclidean distance is sensitive to differences in scale between features, as it takes into account the actual values of the features. Manhattan distance is less sensitive to scale, making it more suitable when features have different units or scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Correlations: Euclidean distance may perform better when features are correlated and exhibit diagonal relationships, as it considers the geometric distance. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, may perform better when correlations are less relevant and the decision boundary is more aligned with the coordinate axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation: Calculating Euclidean distance typically involves square roots and can be computationally more expensive than Manhatta distance"

    "Performance vs. Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller training sets can lead to overfitting because the model may be too sensitive to the specific examples in the training data.\n",
